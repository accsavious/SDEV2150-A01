Observer observed pattern
Reactive mental model
Something happens -> event is emitted -> other code reacts -> the UI updates

Events
are what happened, do not dictate what should happen, all listeners can react

event context: what emitted the event, what its called, what data it carries
what reacts to it. This can all be accessed

Example event: resource-selected
emmited by <resource-results>, fired when a result activated, payload includes the selected resource, event bubbles through dom

Shadow DOM - just for styling

Pub-Sub
publisher subscriber pattern
