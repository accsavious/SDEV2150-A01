Async functionality
Async code allows delays in code to function without disrupting code.
JS does no block
Long operations  move off the call stack, results come back later
Code reacts after results arrive
-A promise
pending, fulfilled, rejected

Coordinating multiple async tasks

const [a, b] = await Promise.all([
	fetch(urlA),
	fetch(urlB),
]);
const response = await fetch(url);
const data await response.json();

History:
Ajax - asynchronous Javascript and XML

JQuery
Terse javascript that made js easy. Its obsolete

Node expanded what js could do from client side only to other options
