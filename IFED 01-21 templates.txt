I forgot to add some files to a commit, but already committed and pushed
how to deal with it

1. add the new files via git add
2. git commit --amend to 'revise' the commit (this will give it a new commit hash, though)

3. providing no one else has pulled/rebased on that commit, I can git push -f to
force-push the change and replace the commit on the remote
