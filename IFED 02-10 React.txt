-REACT INTRO
React components: a function that returns markup

Props - a value you pass to a function
State - how we track status in a component

We will go from
web component to react components
HTML templating to JSX
using tailwind

React works with component libraries
Why vite
fast, modern
JSX
Looks like html

we arent doing yet:
internal state, side effects, minimal prop usage
